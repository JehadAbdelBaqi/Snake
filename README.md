# Snake
The snake game built on Python using the Turtle library.

The game was made using classes. I split the classes into 3 and ran the game on main importing whatever was needed from each class.

The Snake class is anything in relation to the body of the snake and how it operated and moves.

The Food class was the food the snake would eat and the operation system for it.

The Scoreboard class was everything related to the scoreboard, both the actual scoreboard and the keeping of score.

Note - The Scoreboard was later updated to keep highscores.
